# Cursor rules (screenshots-first)

- ALWAYS request a screenshot or URL for the target section before editing.
- If an image path is local, expect it under /mnt/data/assets/ or /mnt/data/.
- For UI effect libraries (e.g., three.js backgrounds): include install instructions in PLAN (e.g., pnpm add three).
- When mapping pixels->tokens, produce a small mapping table in the PLAN.
- MODE must never be skipped.
